# Brain Tumor Classification

> This project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans into categories such as Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, or No Tumor.

## Project Overview

Brain tumors constitute a significant portion of central nervous system tumors worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes image classification techniques to train a model that can analyze Brain MRI scans and classify tumors into specific types.

### Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Google Colaboratory**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raoakif/Brain-Tumor-Classification.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Brain-Tumor-Classification
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Dataset Acquisition

The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from Kaggle. Alternatively, you can find the dataset folder in this repository.

### 4. Run the Notebook

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. You can run it locally or in Google Colab:

- **Local Jupyter Notebook:**

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook Brain_Tumor_Classification.ipynb
  ```

- **Google Colab:**

  Upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run it interactively.

## Project Motivation

The primary goal is to build a model trained on Brain MRI scans to classify images into one of the following categories:

- **Glioma:** Tumors occurring in the brain and/or spinal cord.
- **Meningioma:** Tumors arising from the meningesâ€”the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
- **Pituitary Tumor:** Tumors forming in the pituitary gland inside the skull.
- **No Tumor:** Indicates the absence of a detectable tumor.

## Results

The model was trained and evaluated, achieving significant accuracy in classifying brain tumors. Below is a sample validation result:
